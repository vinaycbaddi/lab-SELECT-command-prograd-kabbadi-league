# ProGrad Lab | ProGrad Pro Kabbadi League 

ProGrad Pro Kabbadi League is gonna begin in a month from now. Our ProGrad organizers are pretty excited to see the champions. We have nearly 20 teams participating in the league. So, there's a lot of data like players, scores etc that need to be collected and stored to decide the winners at each level.

One of our Database specialist has done half the job by creating an ER diagram to visualise the database structure. And, using the same, you have already built the database. 

Now, can you help query a few details that will help us get a few insights?


## What Should You Do
```
Go to Oracle SQL Developer and connect to SYSTEM schema or hr schema.
Start writing your queries in the query builder.
Save the .sql file and upload it in github.
Practice Oracle SQL - SELECT Statements.
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "ProGrad ID"
git push origin master

And finally, create a pull request so your ProGrad Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```

## Instructions

1. ***Do not erase the existing queries.***
2. ***Use the same file to write all your queries.***
3. ***Select the entire query and run it to see the output.***
4. ***Save the file as your_file_name.sql and upload it in github.***
5. ***Refer dml-select-1.sql file.*** 

## Requirements

Oracle 11g Express edition and Oracle SQL Developer
